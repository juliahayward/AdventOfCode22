# AdventOfCode22

My solutions to the Advent of Code 2022.

The aim is to solve the problems as quickly and accurately as possible, not produce production quality code! My aim is to spend 30 minutes per task, and submit no wrong answers. DO NOT code like this in real scenarios :)

Note also that everyone gets different data (other than the examples) so don't rely on any of the answers you see generated by *my* data.
